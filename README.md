## CPU to GPU Production-level Pipeline for AI
At Deep Learning Wizard, we cover the basics of some parts of the whole tech stack for production-level CPU/GPU-powered AI.

This AI pipeline is entirely based on open-source distributions.

This stack would get you started, and enable you to adjust the stack according to your needs.
